# transcendance
For the sake of fullstack

To test this project 
 - git clone this repo
 - cd into it
 - have docker launched
 - docker-compose up --build
(for testing purposes I left the .env file, but removed arguments related to the 42 API for obvious reasons, so the "login with 42" button won't work)

The goal of this project was about creating a simple website to play the original pong game. 
To validate the project we needed a certain amount of features.
